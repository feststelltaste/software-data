# Software data for Software analytics
_A curated repository of data for Software Analytics_

This repository is mere a storage for various types of data that is produced during software development.

## Table of contents

There are two main kind of ordering structures existing:

* [`projects`](projects): Data gained from various projects (ordered by project name)
* [`sources`](sources): Data gained from different kind of software data sources (ordered by type)

## Usage

The idea is to have some stable links to datasets that students can use directly in data analysis frameworks like [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) or [jQAssistant](https://jqassistant.org/).


Have fun!
